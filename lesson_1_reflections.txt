What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

	Cons:
		+ I have to manual commit it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately? 

	Because all files in a commit are relate to each other when changing.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Because I will know what i changed, and after that I can revert to the previous version right away.
